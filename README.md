# boris-tool
This is my rewrite of Chris Miles excellent eddie-tool which is a system and network monitoring, security, and 
performance analysis agent written in Python (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/EDDIE-Tool).  
It uses the eddie-tool core rewritten to work with both Python 2.7 and 3.4+. 
I plan to redevelop the platform specific plug-ins using psutil which did not exist when eddie-tool was released.

# Why name it boris-tool?
It will take a while for the codebase to support the complete functionality of the existing eddie-tool, 
so I consider it the little brother to Eddie. In "The Munster's" TV Series there was an episode where
Eddie asks his parents for a baby brother, Grandpa decides to build a mechanical one, 'Boris' in the basement. (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653052/)
